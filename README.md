A fast and responsive single page web application made with AngularJS.

The MovieDb web application I created with AngularJS utilizes the API from The Movie Database by getting results on trending, upcoming movies etc.. After getting different results, I also used difference data binding capabilities AngularJS provides such as ng-model, ng-bind to filter out movies as well as order by difference criteria. The website is seperated into four sections, trending, now playing, upcoming and top rated. Each of them will query the API to get the most current result from The Movie Database.org as user navigates through them. Users will also be able to click on the movie poster to play trailers on all listed movies as well as click on the name of the movie to get more details on selected movie such as director, writer, studio, a short overview of the movie and what reviewers are saying about this movie.
